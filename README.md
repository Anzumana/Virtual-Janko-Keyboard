# Virtual-Jankó-Keyboard
A basic virtual Jankó piano written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Designed and Programmed by Mannjamin / Ashley Mann.

This is a basic virtual piano based on the designs of Paul von Jankó in 1882.
Paul von Jankó, as the name suggests, invented the Janko Keyboard as an attempt to simply the functionality of the generic piano keyboard.

## Purpose of the Virtual Janko Keyboard
The popularity of the generic keyboard design which has been in use for centuries, has quenched the curiousity of the bold to try new and interesting methods of producing musical art in the form of a keyboard. There are many different layouts of piano keyboard such as Lippens and the Isomorphic keyboards. 

In our current age with the advances of technology, there are many websites suited to allowing indiviuals the oppotunity to play virtual pianos. Most of which only utilise the generic layout. 

Generic Keyboard Layout for reference:

This keyboard limitation is further burdened with the limited functionaly in regards to elements such as Keypress. You may have noticed a large majority of virtual painos only utilise two keyboard rows of a generic QWERTY laptop / computer keyboard.

The overall purpose of this virtual piano was to prodive with with an oppotunity to experience a different style of piano expression. Unlike most keyboards, in regards to the previous sentence; the Virtual Jano Keyboard utilises two full octaves with four QWERTY keyboard rows being utilised for operation. This allows for much more flexibility and creativity when performing.

# Future Improvements
1.  Animate the Buttons (Change Color / Border on keypress)

2.  Make Buttons functional (Currently used for representation only, can be made functional for touch surfaces.)

3.  Utilise other sounds (Make other sounds such as a Synth or Bass)

4.  Adjust the size of the keybed to match full screen on any resolution.
